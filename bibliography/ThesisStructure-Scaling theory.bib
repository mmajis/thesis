abstract = {Starting in the late 1950s, researchers have been performing progressively more sensitive searches for radio signals from extraterrestrial civilizations, but each search has been limited by the technologies available at the time. As radio frequency technologies have became more efficient and computers have become faster, the searches have grown larger and more sensitive, The SETI@home project, managed by a group of researchers at the Space Sciences Laboratory of the University of California, Berkeley, is the first attempt to use large-scale distributed computing to perform a sensitive search for radio signals from extraterrestrial civilizations},

@book{Barish2002,
abstract = {This book shows how to build scalable web applications. It takes an end-to-end perspective and focuses on how developers can use the current set of high-performance Java technologies (servlets, EJB, CORBA, JDBC) to reach that goal. The uniqueness of the book is its most salient feature: the focus on achieving application scalability with an end-to-end perspective. "End-to-end perspective," means that the book shows a sample web application end-to-end, the whole thing. This book is a reference for web engineers that are implementing high-end e-commerce solutions. Commerce on the Internet faces unique challenges, one of which is scalability - the ability for a system to handle large numbers of users, large amounts of data, and high levels of simultaneous requests (such as a million bank transfers per hour) without degrading noticeably in performance. That is the problem area for which this book provides solutions.-- Target market is growing. They now understand the technology and need to write difficult large applications.-- Barish is sn up-and-coming innovator.. He has created a successful start-up company, worked at Oracle, and is now getting his Ph.D. in computer science at USC.-- Scalable web applications, servlets, JSPs, JDBC, EJB.-- This shows how you put all these technologies together and still achieve high-performance web scalability.This timely book helps developers keep up with it all -- and takes them to the next level beyond just programming techniques. Expertly showing how to build and maintain fast and scalable applications is the target. Many books cover specific technologies (e.g. Java servlets); in contrast, this book shows how to command the bigpicture and how to integraate everything to build powerful, fast, and scalable web applications.Scalable and high-performance web applications, Java, application architecture, J2EE, scalability and performance techniques, HTTP client/server communication, web-based request processing, servlets, session management, javabeans, application middleware, databases.Web engineers and Java developers and programmers wanting to take their services to the next level.},
