abstract = {One of the many definitions of “cloud” is that of an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) system, in which IT infrastructure is deployed in a provider’s data center as virtual machines. With IaaS clouds’ growing popularity, tools and technologies are emerging that can transform an organization’s existing infrastructure into a private or hybrid cloud. OpenNebula is an open source, virtual infrastructure manager that deploys virtualized services on both a local pool of resources and external IaaS clouds. Haizea, a resource lease manager, can act as a scheduling back end for OpenNebula, providing features not found in other cloud software or virtualization-based data center management software.},

abstract = {Cassandra is a distributed storage system for managing very large amounts of structured data spread out across many commodity servers, while providing highly available service with no single point of failure. Cassandra aims to run on top of an infrastructure of hundreds of nodes (possibly spread across different data centers). At this scale, small and large components fail continuously. The way Cassandra man- ages the persistent state in the face of these failures drives the reliability and scalability of the software systems rely- ing on this service. While in many ways Cassandra resem- bles a database and shares many design and implementation strategies therewith, Cassandra does not support a full rela- tional data model; instead, it provides clients with a simple data model that supports dynamic control over data lay- out and format. Cassandra system was designed to run on cheap commodity hardware and handle high write through- put while not sacrificing read efficiency.},
