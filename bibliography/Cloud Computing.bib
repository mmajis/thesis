@article{Hunter2009,
abstract = {The concept of cloud computing is going to reorganise the tenets of enterprise IT. Cloud computing sounds like traditional IT outsourcing, but the difference is that this is not just about ownership of IT staff and resources, but a new way of organising, acquiring, and paying for IT infrastructures and services, with outsourcing being just part of the mix. Characterised this way, the move towards cloud computing seems certain, even if enterprises are reluctant to move forward too rapidly right now. Only a few enterprises are actually adopting cloud services at the moment, but the fact that any are is notable. This paper discusses cloud computing's progress within the enterprises.

abstract = {The evolution of cloud computing is driving the next generation of internet services. OpenStack is one of the largest open-source cloud computing middleware development communities. Currently, OpenStack supports platform specific signatures and tokens for user authentication. In this paper, we aim to introduce a cloud platform independent, flexible, and decentralized authentication mechanism, using OpenID as an open-source authentication mechanism in OpenStack. OpenID allows a decentralized framework for user authentication. It has its own advantages for web services, which include improvements in usability and seamless Single-Sign-On experience for the users. This paper presents the OpenlD-Authentication-as-a-Service APIs in OpenStack for front-end GUI servers, and performs the authentication in the back-end at a single Policy Decision Point (PDP). Our implementation allows users to use their OpenID Identifiers from standard OpenTD providers and log into the Dashboard/Django-Nova graphical interface of OpenStack.},

abstract = {A new open-source software project is presented, JEMRIS, the J\"{u}lich Extensible MRI Simulator, which provides an MRI sequence development and simulation environment for the MRI community. The development was driven by the desire to achieve generality of simulated three-dimensional MRI experiments reflecting modern MRI systems hardware. The accompanying computational burden is overcome by means of parallel computing. Many aspects are covered that have not hitherto been simultaneously investigated in general MRI simulations such as parallel transmit and receive, important off-resonance effects, nonlinear gradients, and arbitrary spatiotemporal parameter variations at different levels. The latter can be used to simulate various types of motion, for instance. The JEMRIS user interface is very simple to use, but nevertheless it presents few limitations. MRI sequences with arbitrary waveforms and complex interdependent modules are modeled in a graphical user interface-based environment requiring no further programming. This manuscript describes the concepts, methods, and performance of the software. Examples of novel simulation results in active fields of MRI research are given.},

abstract = {Computing as a utility has reached the mainstream. Scientists can now rent time on large commercial clusters through several vendors. The cloud computing model provides flexible support for "pay as you go" systems. In addition to no upfront investment in large clusters or supercomputers, such systems incur no maintenance costs. Furthermore, they can be expanded and reduced on-demand in real-time. Current cloud computing performance falls short of systems specifically designed for scientific applications. Scientific computing needs are quite different from those of web applications--composed primarily of database queries--that have been the focus of cloud computing vendors. In this paper we investigate the use of cloud computing for high-performance numerical applications. In particular, we assume unlimited monetary resources to answer the question, "How high can a cloud computing service get in the TOP500 list?" We show results for the Linpack benchmark on different allocations on Amazon EC2.},

abstract = {A new open-source software project is presented, JEMRIS, the J\"{u}lich Extensible MRI Simulator, which provides an MRI sequence development and simulation environment for the MRI community. The development was driven by the desire to achieve generality of simulated three-dimensional MRI experiments reflecting modern MRI systems hardware. The accompanying computational burden is overcome by means of parallel computing. Many aspects are covered that have not hitherto been simultaneously investigated in general MRI simulations such as parallel transmit and receive, important off-resonance effects, nonlinear gradients, and arbitrary spatiotemporal parameter variations at different levels. The latter can be used to simulate various types of motion, for instance. The JEMRIS user interface is very simple to use, but nevertheless it presents few limitations. MRI sequences with arbitrary waveforms and complex interdependent modules are modeled in a graphical user interface-based environment requiring no further programming. This manuscript describes the concepts, methods, and performance of the software. Examples of novel simulation results in active fields of MRI research are given.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the structure of specimens is crucial to determine the role that they play in cellular and molecular biology. To yield the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction by means of tomographic reconstruction algorithms, we need the use of large projection images and high processing time. Therefore, we propose the use of the high performance computing (HPC) to cope with the huge computational demands of this problem. We have implemented a HPC strategy where the distribution of tasks follows the master-slave paradigm. The master processor distributes a slab of slices, a piece of the final 3D structure to reconstruct, among the slave processors and receives reconstructed slices of the volume. We have evaluated the performance of our HPC approach using different sizes of the slab. We have observed that it is possible to find out an optimal size of the slab for the number of processor used that minimize communications time while maintaining a reasonable grain of parallelism to be exploited by the set of processors.},

abstract = {Affymetrix SNP arrays can interrogate thousands of SNPs at the same time. This allows us to look at the genomic content of cancer cells and to investigate the underlying events leading to cancer. Genomic copy-numbers are today routinely derived from SNP array data, but the proposed algorithms for this task most often disregard the genotype information available from germline cells in paired germline-tumour samples. Including this information may deepen our understanding of the "true" biological situation e.g. by enabling analysis of allele specific copy-numbers. Here we rely on matched germline-tumour samples and have developed a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to estimate allelic copy-number changes in tumour cells. Further with this approach we are able to estimate the proportion of normal cells in the tumour (mixture proportion).},

abstract = {Cloud computing has been envisioned as the next-generation architecture of IT enterprise. In contrast to traditional solutions, where the IT services are under proper physical, logical and personnel controls, cloud computing moves the application software and databases to the large data centers, where the management of the data and services may not be fully trustworthy. This unique attribute, however, poses many new security challenges which have not been well understood. In this article, we focus on cloud data storage security, which has always been an important aspect of quality of service. To ensure the correctness of users' data in the cloud, we propose an effective and flexible distributed scheme with two salient features, opposing to its predecessors. By utilizing the homomorphic token with distributed verification of erasure-coded data, our scheme achieves the integration of storage correctness insurance and data error localization, i.e., the identification of misbehaving server (s). Unlike most prior works, the new scheme further supports secure and efficient dynamic operations on data blocks, including: data update, delete and append. Extensive security and performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme is highly efficient and resilient against Byzantine failure, malicious data modification attack, and even server colluding attacks.},

@unpublished{Caron2012,
abstract = {Over the past years, the Cloud phenomenon had an impressive increase in popularity in both the software industry and research worlds. The most interesting feature that Cloud Computing brings, from a Cloud client's point of view, is the on-demand resource provisioning model. This allows Cloud client platforms to be scaled up in order to accommodate more incoming clients and to scale down when the platform has unused resources, and this can all be done while the platform is running. As a result, the physical resources are used more efficiently and the Cloud client saves expenses. Achieving the above mentioned is not trivial and is done by leveraging more direct functionalities that Clouds provide. Three of these key functionalities are automatic scaling, load balancing and monitoring. They represent the focus of the current work. This report is divided into three main parts, one for each of the three main topics of interest: auto-scaling, load balancing and monitoring. We detail each of the three topics and present details on their presence and implementation in the commercial, open-source and research worlds. Among the commercial Cloud platform providers we have focused on Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure, GoGrid and RackSpace. From the open-source initiatives we have focused our attention on Nimbus, Eucalyptus and OpenNebula. We have also detailed endeavours in the research world that are relevant to the topic of interest and are not connected to any of the Cloud providers. By studying this report, the reader will be able to understand the role that each of the three Cloud features plays for a Cloud client, will understand their inner workings and will be aware of the state-of-the-art available in current commercial and open-source Cloud platforms.},
