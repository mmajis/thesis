abstract = {This report presents best practices for cloud computing. It introduces the main technologies currently used in cloud computing. It then discusses the main commercial offerings and their programming models. We discuss hard- ware virtualization technologies used in datacenters, and three different ser- vice abstraction levels: infrastructure, platform and applications. Also the main drivers and adoption problems in cloud computing are covered. The report contains sections on scalable cloud technologies, cloud from the ap- plication programmers view, security and privacy in the cloud, as well as the use of clouds for machine learning and data mining. In this version of the report a major part of the contents are case studies performed in the Cloud Software project as well as the best practices learned from the case studies.},

abstract = {Cloud computing has become a significant technology trend. Experts believe cloud computing is currently reshaping information technology and the IT marketplace. The advantages of using cloud computing include cost savings, speed to market, access to greater computing resources, high availability, and scalability. Handbook of Cloud Computing includes contributions from world experts in the field of cloud computing from academia, research laboratories and private industry. This book presents the systems, tools, and services of the leading providers of cloud computing; including Google, Yahoo, Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft. The basic concepts of cloud computing and cloud computing applications are also introduced. Current and future technologies applied in cloud computing are also discussed. Case studies, examples, and exercises are provided throughout. Topics covered include, among others: • Cloud Computing Fundamentals • Systems and Tools • Cloud Applications and Solutions • Data-Intensive Supercomputer in the Cloud • High Performance Computing • Virtual Private Clouds • Scientific Services and Data Management in the Cloud • Enterprise Knowledge Clouds • Medical Information Systems Handbook of Cloud Computing is intended for advanced-level students and researchers in computer science and electrical engineering as a reference book. This handbook is also beneficial to computer and system infrastructure designers, developers, business managers, entrepreneurs and investors within the cloud computing related industry.},

@article{CMK09,
abstract = {Scalability is critical to the success of many enterprises currently involved in doing business on the web and in providing information that may vary drastically from one time to another. Maintaining sufficient resources just to meet peak requirements can be costly. Cloud computing provides a powerful computing model that allows users to access resources on-demand. In this paper, we will describe a novel architecture for the dynamic scaling of web applications based on thresholds in a virtualized Cloud Computing environment. We will illustrate our scaling approach with a front-end load-balancer for routing and balancing user requests to web applications deployed on web servers installed in virtual machine instances. A dynamic scaling algorithm for automated provisioning of virtual machine resources based on threshold number of active sessions will be introduced. The on-demand capability of the Cloud to rapidly provision and dynamically allocate resources to users will be discussed. Our work has demonstrated the compelling benefits of the Cloud which is capable of handling sudden load surges, delivering IT resources on-demands to users, and maintaining higher resource utilization, thus reducing infrastructure and management costs.},
