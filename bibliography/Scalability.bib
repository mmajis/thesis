abstract = {The term scalability appears frequently in computing literature, but it is a term that is poorly defined and poorly understood. It is an important attribute of computer systems that is frequently asserted but rarely validated in any meaningful, systematic way. The lack of a consistent, uniform and systematic treatment of scalability makes it difficult to identify and avoid scalability problems, clearly and objectively describe the scalability of software systems, evaluate claims of scalability, and compare claims from different sources. This thesis provides a definition of scalability and describes a systematic framework for the characterization and analysis of software systems scalability. The framework is comprised of a goal-oriented approach for describing, modeling and reasoning about scalability requirements, and an analysis technique that captures the dependency relationships that underlie typical notions of scalability. The framework is validated against a real-world data analysis system and is used to recast a number of examples taken from the computing literature and from industry in order to demonstrate its use across different application domains and system designs.},

abstract = {Scale-up solutions in the form of large SMPs have represented the mainstream of commercial computing for the past several years. The major server vendors continue to provide increasingly larger and more powerful machines. More recently, scale-out solutions, in the form of clusters of smaller machines, have gained increased acceptance for commercial computing. Scale-out solutions are particularly effective in high-throughput Web-centric applications. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of two competing approaches to parallelism, scale-up and scale-out, in an emerging search application. Our conclusions show that a scale-out strategy can be the key to good performance even on a scale-up machine. Furthermore, scale-out solutions offer better price/performance, although at an increase in management complexity.},

@article{CMK09,
abstract = {Scalability is critical to the success of many enterprises currently involved in doing business on the web and in providing information that may vary drastically from one time to another. Maintaining sufficient resources just to meet peak requirements can be costly. Cloud computing provides a powerful computing model that allows users to access resources on-demand. In this paper, we will describe a novel architecture for the dynamic scaling of web applications based on thresholds in a virtualized Cloud Computing environment. We will illustrate our scaling approach with a front-end load-balancer for routing and balancing user requests to web applications deployed on web servers installed in virtual machine instances. A dynamic scaling algorithm for automated provisioning of virtual machine resources based on threshold number of active sessions will be introduced. The on-demand capability of the Cloud to rapidly provision and dynamically allocate resources to users will be discussed. Our work has demonstrated the compelling benefits of the Cloud which is capable of handling sudden load surges, delivering IT resources on-demands to users, and maintaining higher resource utilization, thus reducing infrastructure and management costs.},
