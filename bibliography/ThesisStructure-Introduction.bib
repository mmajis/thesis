abstract = {Cloud computing is evolving as a key computing platform for sharing resources that include infrastructures, software, applications, and business processes. Virtualization is a core technology for enabling cloud resource sharing. However, most existing cloud computing platforms have not formally adopted the service-oriented architecture (SOA) that would make them more flexible, extensible, and reusable. By bridging the power of SOA and virtualization in the context of cloud computing ecosystem, this paper presents seven architectural principles and derives ten interconnected architectural modules to form a reusable and customizable cloud computing open architecture (CCOA). Two case studies on infrastructure and business cloud are used to deliver business and practical value of infrastructure and business process provisioning services over the Internet. We also present some potential value-added services of the proposed CCOA to guide strategic planning and other consulting practices of cloud computing.},

It then discusses the main commercial offerings and their programming models. We discuss hard- ware virtualization technologies used in datacenters, and three different ser- vice abstraction levels: infrastructure, platform and applications. Also the main drivers and adoption problems in cloud computing are covered. The report contains sections on scalable cloud technologies, cloud from the ap- plication programmers view, security and privacy in the cloud, as well as the use of clouds for machine learning and data mining. In this version of the report a major part of the contents are case studies performed in the Cloud Software project as well as the best practices learned from the case studies.},
