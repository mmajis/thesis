@article{LiW09,
abstract = {Web applications’ traffic demand fluctuates widely and unpredictably. The common practice of provisioning a fixed capacity would either result in unsatisfied customers (underprovision) or waste valuable capital investment (overprovision). By leveraging an infrastructure cloud’s on-demand, pay-per-use capabilities, we finally can match the capacity with the demand in real time. This paper investigates how we can build a web server farm in the cloud. We first present a benchmark performance study on various cloud components, which not only shows their performance results, but also reveals their limitations. Because of the limitations, no single configuration of cloud components can excel in all traffic scenarios. We then propose a dynamic switching architecture which dynamically switches among several configurations depending on the workload and traffic pattern.},

@article{CMK09,
abstract = {Scalability is critical to the success of many enterprises currently involved in doing business on the web and in providing information that may vary drastically from one time to another. Maintaining sufficient resources just to meet peak requirements can be costly. Cloud computing provides a powerful computing model that allows users to access resources on-demand. In this paper, we will describe a novel architecture for the dynamic scaling of web applications based on thresholds in a virtualized Cloud Computing environment. We will illustrate our scaling approach with a front-end load-balancer for routing and balancing user requests to web applications deployed on web servers installed in virtual machine instances. A dynamic scaling algorithm for automated provisioning of virtual machine resources based on threshold number of active sessions will be introduced. The on-demand capability of the Cloud to rapidly provision and dynamically allocate resources to users will be discussed. Our work has demonstrated the compelling benefits of the Cloud which is capable of handling sudden load surges, delivering IT resources on-demands to users, and maintaining higher resource utilization, thus reducing infrastructure and management costs.},
