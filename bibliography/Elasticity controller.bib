@article{LiW09,
abstract = {Web applications’ traffic demand fluctuates widely and unpredictably. The common practice of provisioning a fixed capacity would either result in unsatisfied customers (underprovision) or waste valuable capital investment (overprovision). By leveraging an infrastructure cloud’s on-demand, pay-per-use capabilities, we finally can match the capacity with the demand in real time. This paper investigates how we can build a web server farm in the cloud. We first present a benchmark performance study on various cloud components, which not only shows their performance results, but also reveals their limitations. Because of the limitations, no single configuration of cloud components can excel in all traffic scenarios. We then propose a dynamic switching architecture which dynamically switches among several configurations depending on the workload and traffic pattern.},
