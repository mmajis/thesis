abstract = {This report presents best practices for cloud computing. It introduces the main technologies currently used in cloud computing. It then discusses the main commercial offerings and their programming models. We discuss hard- ware virtualization technologies used in datacenters, and three different ser- vice abstraction levels: infrastructure, platform and applications. Also the main drivers and adoption problems in cloud computing are covered. The report contains sections on scalable cloud technologies, cloud from the ap- plication programmers view, security and privacy in the cloud, as well as the use of clouds for machine learning and data mining. In this version of the report a major part of the contents are case studies performed in the Cloud Software project as well as the best practices learned from the case studies.},

abstract = {Starting in the late 1950s, researchers have been performing progressively more sensitive searches for radio signals from extraterrestrial civilizations, but each search has been limited by the technologies available at the time. As radio frequency technologies have became more efficient and computers have become faster, the searches have grown larger and more sensitive, The SETI@home project, managed by a group of researchers at the Space Sciences Laboratory of the University of California, Berkeley, is the first attempt to use large-scale distributed computing to perform a sensitive search for radio signals from extraterrestrial civilizations},

abstract = {Cloud computing is evolving as a key computing platform for sharing resources that include infrastructures, software, applications, and business processes. Virtualization is a core technology for enabling cloud resource sharing. However, most existing cloud computing platforms have not formally adopted the service-oriented architecture (SOA) that would make them more flexible, extensible, and reusable. By bridging the power of SOA and virtualization in the context of cloud computing ecosystem, this paper presents seven architectural principles and derives ten interconnected architectural modules to form a reusable and customizable cloud computing open architecture (CCOA). Two case studies on infrastructure and business cloud are used to deliver business and practical value of infrastructure and business process provisioning services over the Internet. We also present some potential value-added services of the proposed CCOA to guide strategic planning and other consulting practices of cloud computing.},

@article{LiW09,
abstract = {Web applications’ traffic demand fluctuates widely and unpredictably. The common practice of provisioning a fixed capacity would either result in unsatisfied customers (underprovision) or waste valuable capital investment (overprovision). By leveraging an infrastructure cloud’s on-demand, pay-per-use capabilities, we finally can match the capacity with the demand in real time. This paper investigates how we can build a web server farm in the cloud. We first present a benchmark performance study on various cloud components, which not only shows their performance results, but also reveals their limitations. Because of the limitations, no single configuration of cloud components can excel in all traffic scenarios. We then propose a dynamic switching architecture which dynamically switches among several configurations depending on the workload and traffic pattern.},

@book{Barish2002,
abstract = {This book shows how to build scalable web applications. It takes an end-to-end perspective and focuses on how developers can use the current set of high-performance Java technologies (servlets, EJB, CORBA, JDBC) to reach that goal. The uniqueness of the book is its most salient feature: the focus on achieving application scalability with an end-to-end perspective. "End-to-end perspective," means that the book shows a sample web application end-to-end, the whole thing. This book is a reference for web engineers that are implementing high-end e-commerce solutions. Commerce on the Internet faces unique challenges, one of which is scalability - the ability for a system to handle large numbers of users, large amounts of data, and high levels of simultaneous requests (such as a million bank transfers per hour) without degrading noticeably in performance. That is the problem area for which this book provides solutions.-- Target market is growing. They now understand the technology and need to write difficult large applications.-- Barish is sn up-and-coming innovator.. He has created a successful start-up company, worked at Oracle, and is now getting his Ph.D. in computer science at USC.-- Scalable web applications, servlets, JSPs, JDBC, EJB.-- This shows how you put all these technologies together and still achieve high-performance web scalability.This timely book helps developers keep up with it all -- and takes them to the next level beyond just programming techniques. Expertly showing how to build and maintain fast and scalable applications is the target. Many books cover specific technologies (e.g. Java servlets); in contrast, this book shows how to command the bigpicture and how to integraate everything to build powerful, fast, and scalable web applications.Scalable and high-performance web applications, Java, application architecture, J2EE, scalability and performance techniques, HTTP client/server communication, web-based request processing, servlets, session management, javabeans, application middleware, databases.Web engineers and Java developers and programmers wanting to take their services to the next level.},

@article{CMK09,
abstract = {Scalability is critical to the success of many enterprises currently involved in doing business on the web and in providing information that may vary drastically from one time to another. Maintaining sufficient resources just to meet peak requirements can be costly. Cloud computing provides a powerful computing model that allows users to access resources on-demand. In this paper, we will describe a novel architecture for the dynamic scaling of web applications based on thresholds in a virtualized Cloud Computing environment. We will illustrate our scaling approach with a front-end load-balancer for routing and balancing user requests to web applications deployed on web servers installed in virtual machine instances. A dynamic scaling algorithm for automated provisioning of virtual machine resources based on threshold number of active sessions will be introduced. The on-demand capability of the Cloud to rapidly provision and dynamically allocate resources to users will be discussed. Our work has demonstrated the compelling benefits of the Cloud which is capable of handling sudden load surges, delivering IT resources on-demands to users, and maintaining higher resource utilization, thus reducing infrastructure and management costs.},
