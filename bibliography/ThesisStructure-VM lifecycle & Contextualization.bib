Automated provisioning requires the handling of operating system, network, and application specific customization. This article provides a sample framework for automating virtual image deployment and activation, including example code for quickly and easily provisioning new IBM® WebSphere® Application Server environments.

@article{CMK09,
abstract = {Scalability is critical to the success of many enterprises currently involved in doing business on the web and in providing information that may vary drastically from one time to another. Maintaining sufficient resources just to meet peak requirements can be costly. Cloud computing provides a powerful computing model that allows users to access resources on-demand. In this paper, we will describe a novel architecture for the dynamic scaling of web applications based on thresholds in a virtualized Cloud Computing environment. We will illustrate our scaling approach with a front-end load-balancer for routing and balancing user requests to web applications deployed on web servers installed in virtual machine instances. A dynamic scaling algorithm for automated provisioning of virtual machine resources based on threshold number of active sessions will be introduced. The on-demand capability of the Cloud to rapidly provision and dynamically allocate resources to users will be discussed. Our work has demonstrated the compelling benefits of the Cloud which is capable of handling sudden load surges, delivering IT resources on-demands to users, and maintaining higher resource utilization, thus reducing infrastructure and management costs.},
